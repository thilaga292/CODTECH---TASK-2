## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

### Project: *Weather Forecast Application.*


### Objective

The objective of this project is to create, design and implement an efficient and user-friendly Weather Forecast web application system that helps user to know about weather details of any city using its name only. It aims to deliver real-time, precise weather details for decision-making in travel, planning, and daily activities.

### Goals/Scope

- User-friendly Interface.
- Accurate weather Details(Temperature, Wind speed, Humidity, Weather Description, etc..).
- Fast data Fetching.
- Efficient weather searching.

### Requirements

- Operating System: Windows 7, 8, 9, 10 .
- Language: Html , Css , Javascript.
- API: Openweathermap API.

### Technologies used

*Frontend*

- HTML - This is a fundamental technology used to design the structure and layout of the web page. It organize, format, and display a web page’s content along with CSS and Javascript
- CSS - CSS is used to style existing HTML elements by adding designs and responsiveness to web pages. It controls various aspects of a website’s appearance, including text style, size, positioning, color, and more.
  
*Backend*

- JavaScript - JavaScript is a single-threaded, synchronous programming and scripting language widely used in web development. It is used to add interactive behavior to web pages and enables dynamic interactivity on websites when it is applied to an HTML document.

### Approach
- Use HTML to give structure to your project.
- Use CSS for Styling purposes
- JavaScript will be used to provide the required functionality. Such as,
  
                - Displaying date and time.
  
                - Displaying pop-up window and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box).
  
                - Fetching information from openWeather API and Client-side validation.


### Benefits

- Immediate access to local weather conditions of any location around the world.
- Real-time notifications about prevailing and expected weather conditions.
- User-friendly interface with essential weather details and description.
- Convenient convertion of Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- Easy User Interface.

### Limitations

- Dependency on External API’s: Downtime or changes to the external service can affect the functionality of the application.
- Device and Network Dependency: The user experience can be affected by the device’s capabilities and network conditions.
- Security and Privacy Concerns: Handling user data, such as location information, requires attention to privacy and security. Ensuring secure data transmission and storage is crucial to protect user information.

### Conclusion

In the current era, research in weather measurement, monitoring and forecasting are become more and more relevant. This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an affordable mini weather forecast web application that ensures flexibility, portability, scability and user friendly operations which can provide data of some weather variables including temperature, humidity and pressure.
